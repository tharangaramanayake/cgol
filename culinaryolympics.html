						<p>The Culinary Olympics, held for the first time in 1900, takes place every four years. The team of 24, experienced as well as amateur chefs from around the country was selected and given intense training over the past year, under the watchful eyes of Chairman of the Chef&#8242;s Guild of Sri Lanka and master chocolatier Gerard himself, and Dimuthu Kumarasinghe &#8211; one of the most highly regarded chefs in the country, who had bagged five gold medals at previous Culinary Olympics in Europe. &#8220;We have some marvellous young chefs, and I wanted to pick up talent from all parts of the country,&#8221; Gerard adds, saying that their selection scope was wide &#8211; the results now justifying their faith in their proteges. Every single member of the team bagged a medal in their respective events.</p>
						<p>The team comprised chefs from Jetwing Lighthouse, Galle, Cinnamon Grand, Heritance Ahungalla, Hilton Colombo, Grand Hotel Nuwara Eliya, Cinnamon Lodge, Habarana, Water&#8242;s Edge, Eden Hotel, and Perera and Sons as well as young chefs from various parts of the country. The categories included Five&#8211;course Set Dinner Menu, Plated Desserts, Buffet Platter, Tapas, Salt Dough Carvings, Chocolate carving, Pastilliage sugar sculptures and Wedding Cakes.</p>
						<p>Chef Dimuthu Kumarasinghe and Chef Shrimal Kulatunga, bagged the gold medals for the overall pastry challenge. Chef Thilak Senaratne bagged two golds, Chef H.P. Kumara De Silva bagged a gold and silver, Chef Kodikarage Athula won two golds and a silver, Chef M.M. Laxman bagged the gold at the &#8221;Wedding cake&#8220; event, Chef N.P Wijesiri Jayawardena won two golds and Chef Anuraddha bagged another gold medal.</p>
						<p>Silver medals were won by Chef Shrimal, Chef Manjula Wikrema, Chef Chamaka Perera, Chef Kasun Premachandra, and Chef Sanjeewa Niroshan, representing the Regional event, as well as Chef Nimal Rajapakse and Chef Narampanawa.</p>
						<p>Chef Dimuthu Kumarasinghe and Chef Srimal Kulathunga stunned the audiences by winning the gold medal for the overall pastry challenge &#8211; a field regarded as a European stronghold. Carrying their sculptures and utensils with them all the way to Germany was no cakewalk.</p>
						<p>Sri Lanka&#8216;s National Pastry team excelled at the recent Culinary Olympics in Frankfurt winning the National Pastry team award with six golds. The golds shared by Sri Lanka&#8216;s young culinary wizard Dimuthu Kumarasinghe and his apprentice Srimal Kulatunge.</p>
						<p>Sri Lanka also won a silver at the Regional Event competing with 54 countries</p>
						<p>Kumarasinghe also holds the world record for the highest number of individual golds at both Culinary Olympics and the Culinary World Cup with 12 medals.</p>
						<p>The individual participants, institutions and hotels who won golds for Sri Lanka at this event were Eden Hotel, Cinnamon Grand Hote,.Waters Edge,Cinnamon Lodge, Perera and Sons and well known culinary artist and chef Tilak Senaratne. They shared nine medals among themselves.</p>
						<p>Kumarasinghe won five golds at the Culinary Olympics in 2004 which is also the highest number of golds won by any individual at this event so far.It was followed by four more golds at the 2006 Culinary World Cup.</p>
						<p>In 2008 he didn&#8216;t take part in the Culinary Olympics, opting to be the Pastry Art Coach of the Team Ontario.</p>
						<p>Kumarasinghe&#8216;s assistant at the event was Pastry Chef at Jetwing Light House in Galle and he had started his career at the five star Kandalama hotel in 2001. &#8221;He had great potential and was fortunate to have trained Kulatunge at the initial stages and all indications are that he would go a long way as a Chef,&#8220; Kumarasinghe said with pride.</p>
						<p>He also paid a tribute to his &#8221;Guru&#8220; and veteran Chef and Vice </p>
						<p>President (Aitken Spence Hotels and Heritance Hotels) Gemunu Goonawardene whom he claims to be responsible for training him and taught the finer points of culinary art.</p>
						<p>He was also grateful to Malin Hapugoda, the Managing Drector, Aitken Spence Hotels and the company for supporting his endeavours.</p>
						<p>He also said that it was his elder brother Damith Indrajith Kumarasinghe, Master Chef at Taj Samudra Hotel who introduced him to the world of culinary art and encouraged him.</p>
						<p>&#8221;Gerard Mendis ,the Chairman, Chefs Guild of Lanka was the livewire in organising the participation of the Sri Lanka team and the Madhawa Weerabaddhana who also played a key role in assisting the team at the event,&#8220; he said.</p>
